## Overview
The `install-dotnet.sh` script automates the installation of the .NET SDK on Debian-based and RPM-based Linux distributions. The script allows the user to choose between installing the .NET SDK via APT/DNF/YUM or Snap.

## Prerequisites
- The user must have `sudo` privileges to install the necessary packages.
- Internet connection is required to download the necessary dependencies.
- Ensure `wget` and `lsb_release` are installed for Debian-based systems.
- No end-user license agreements (EULA) were detected in the installation process. If any are required, modifications may be necessary.

## Installation
```bash
chmod +x install-dotnet.sh
./install-dotnet.sh
```
The script will prompt you to choose an installation method and proceed with the appropriate package installation.

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Select the installation method:
   - Option 1: Install via APT/DNF/YUM (Recommended)
   - Option 2: Install via Snap
3. The script will proceed with the installation based on your selection.
4. After installation, verify using:
   ```bash
   dotnet --version
   ```

## Additional Testing and Setup
- After installation, restart the terminal to ensure environment variables are updated.
- If installed via Snap, ensure the `dotnet` alias is properly set up using:
   ```bash
   sudo snap alias dotnet-sdk.dotnet dotnet
   ```
